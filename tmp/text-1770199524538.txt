The Great Fire of London occurred on September 2, 1666, and lasted for four days. It started at a bakery on Pudding Lane, and quickly spread due to strong winds and closely-packed wooden buildings. The fire destroyed over 13,000 houses, 87 churches, and 44 guild halls, leaving around 70,000 people homeless. However, the fire led to significant changes in building codes and emergency preparedness in London, and it paved the way for the city's rebuilding and modernization.
