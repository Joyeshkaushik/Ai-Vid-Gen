In ancient Egypt, around 2500 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu. It's believed that over 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing around 2.5 tons, were used to construct this magnificent structure. The pyramid's original height was around 146.5 meters, making it the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. The Great Pyramid of Giza is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and is still an awe-inspiring sight today.
